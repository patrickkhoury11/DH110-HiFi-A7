## Brief Summary: Purposes and Process

- This project will promote efficiency and convenience for user sustainability efforts by consolidating a variety of environmentally-conscious activities and services into one mobile application, presented as a social media platform. The aforementioned activities and services would be geared towards target users’ needs and daily lifestyle; for example, including carpooling, thrifting/clothing swaps, furniture repurposing, sustainability events, etc. In this way, my project will mainly support users in gaining an environmentally-conscious community and lowering barriers to access for information about related activities and services.

- The purpose of this interface design is to convert the previously created low-fidelity designs into a digitized design with carefully selected graphic variations (i.e. typographic variation, shape variation, color variation, etc). Furthermore, graphic principles such as readability, user comprehension, and general accessibility were also prioritized in this process. The process of digitizing my low-fidelity design was done through the online interface design tool, Figma. The dimensions of the frames for these designs were based on the iPhone 14 Pro Max screen size. I utilized various resources to create the graphic design system, including Google Fonts, Spark, Adobe Color, Material Design, and other online information sources. User interface is vital in meeting user expectations, as the program’s design plays a huge role in its functionality and overall appeal.

## Interactive Prototypes Supported by the System

Task 1: Shop for a second-hand desk within a 5 mile radius
- You need a cheap desk for your apartment after living life in the dorms your freshman year. You would like the desk to be second-hand, as your roommate Noah is passionate about sustainable living. You do not own a car, so you would like the desk to be in a 5 mile radius from UCSD.

Task 2: Change the bio and link on the profile page
- You recently won the election to become the Vice President of the Ocean Resources for Conservation and Advocacy (ORCA) organization. They are holding their first meeting this upcoming Friday. You would like to change your bio in the application to show off your new title and publish the sign-up link to your profile so your followers can sign up to come to the first official meeting.
